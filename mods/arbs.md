# Aftermarket anti-roll bars

Below is my catalog of aftermarket anti-roll bars (also known as ARBs, sway
bars, "sways").

The numbers were calculated based on the manufacturer's claims such as "+123%
stiffness compared to stock (2013-2016 OEM bar)". Please let me know if you can
find more trustworthy numbers! Also other contributions to this page are very
much welcome.

Each list is ordered roughly from the softest to stiffest options. All values
are provided in lbs/in (shame on me), rounded to the nearest integer.
