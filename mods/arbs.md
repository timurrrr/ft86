# Aftermarket anti-roll bars

Below is my catalog of aftermarket anti-roll bars (also known as ARBs, sway bars, "sways").

Unfortunately, most manufacturers use relative values (such as "+123% stiffness compared to stock")
instead of absolute values (such as "123 lb/in") for their bars, often don't even specify which
stock bar was used as a reference (different OE bars have different stiffness). On top of that, some
of the commonly-shared stiffness numbers for the OE bars were measured inaccurately...

I'd be great to get _accurately_ measured absolute values and add them here (feel free to send a 
Pull request!).

This catalog compiles the known bars roughly in the softer-to-stiffer order. Manufacturer claims
about the stiffness are provided where present.

I tried to provide links to most bars on the manufacturers' websites, but couldn't easily find some
of them, in which cases I provided links to third party resellers. I'm not affiliated with any of
them, and just picked whatever was at the top of Google results.

Pull requests with corrections, additions and better product links are welcome!
