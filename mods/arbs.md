# Aftermarket anti-roll bars

Below is my catalog of aftermarket anti-roll bars (also known as ARBs, sway bars, "sways").

Unfortunately, most manufacturers use relative values (such as "+123% stiffness compared to stock")
instead of absolute values (such as "123 lb/in") for their bars, often don't even specify which
stock bar was used as a reference (different OE bars have different stiffness). On top of that, some
of the commonly-shared stiffness numbers for the OE bars were measured inaccurately...

I'd be great to get _accurately_ measured absolute values and add them here (feel free to send a 
Pull request!).

This catalog compiles the known bars roughly in the softer-to-stiffer order. Manufacturer claims
about the stiffness are provided.
