# CAN bus (2022 model year)

## Pre-word

The purpose of this page is to document as much data channels on the CAN bus
as possible. If your goal is to set up data logging in RaceChrono, there is
a better alternative:
https://github.com/timurrrr/RaceChronoDiyBleDevice/blob/master/can_db/ft86_gen2.md

Special thanks to Ken Houseal for his early legwork on finding and documenting
how to connect to the CAN bus, and finding some of these data mappings!

## Connections

The ODB-II in the driver's footwell no longer exposes the CAN bus data except
for OBD-II requests. If you want to log data with high refresh rates, you need
to use an alternative connection. There are multiple options with different pros
and cons. Below are the recommended ones:

### DCM Connector

**Not available on US market Subaru BRZs.** (Subaru, get your act together?)

GR86s and EU market BRZs have an unused connector hidden behind the glovebox,
near the cabin air filter and the 12V socket:

You can carefully peel off the tape that keeps it out of the way. It's hard but
doable, take your time!

  alt="A look at of the DCM connector" width="500" height="342" />

You can buy a DCM/OBD adapter [from Hachi Electronics](https://hachielectronics.com/products/2022-gr86-brz-asc-can-adapter?variant=49925762810145).

Alternatively, you can make your own harness.
You can use the two middle pins of a
[Toyota radio harness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002BEQJ8)
to connect to the CAN bus through that connector.\
Here are the pins that you need to use:

The green wire on the photo is CAN H, the white wire is CAN L.

### ASC port

**This is only recommended for US BRZ owners, as it lacks some data.**

A common place to get access to the CAN bus is the ASC (a.k.a. "fake engine
noise") female connector. It is located inside the dash slightly to the right of
the glovebox, and is accessible by pulling off the panel on the right side of
the dash. The photo below shows the normal location of the connector with an
arrow, and you can see the disconnected connector dangling in the bottom right
of the photo:

<img src="../images/gen2_asc_connector_access.jpg"
  alt="Location of the ASC connector" width="500" height="500" />

You can buy an off-the-shelf harness that taps into the ASC connector and
provides access to the CAN bus in an OBD-II form factor:

* https://hachielectronics.com/products/2022-gr86-brz-asc-can-adapter
* https://ansixauto.com/2022-brz-gt86-can-adapter (has an option to pass through the ASC connections)

Alternatively, you can make your own connector.
You can then buy a male connector by TE Connectivity, part number 1376106-1.
You will also need to buy male pins, part number 1376109-1.

If you're ok with not having the ASC, you need to get at least one connector and
two pins. It might be useful to get some extra in case you fail to crimp the
pins, or something like that.

If you want to keep ASC working, you can also buy a female connector and female
pins, and make a "T" bridge. The part numbers and wiring schematics are out of
scope of this documentation.

Here's how you should wire the male connector:

The blue wire on this photo is CAN H, the white wire is CAN L.

## Details on some CAN IDs

Below are the examples of some high-frequency CAN IDs, along with some of the
data channels that have already been decoded.

Note that the "equation" column in the decoding tables uses the
[RaceChrono equation format](https://racechrono.com/support/equations).

For example, if the data is\
`0x 12 34 56 78 90 AB CD EF`\
where bytes are named\
`-- (A)(B)(C)(D)(E)(F)(G)(H)`,\
then here is how different equations are calculated:

Equation | Value (hex) | Value (dec)
-------- | ----------- | -----------
`A`      | `0x12`      | 18
`B`      | `0x34`      | 52
`F`      | `0xAB`      | 171
`F * 0.1` | N/A        | 17.1
`bytesToIntLe(raw, 0, 2)` | `0x3412` | 13330
`bytesToIntLe(raw, 3, 2)` | `0x9078` | -28552
`bitsToIntLe(raw, 4, 12)` | `0x341`  | 833

You should be able to figure out the format for these equation for other data
logging systems.

### CAN ID 0x6E2 (1762)

Update frequency: 1 per second.

Example values (from a US car):\
`0x 00 00 04 FE FE FE FE FE` (when pressures aren't displayed shortly after turning ignition on)\
`0x 00 00 04 48 42 46 44 FE` (tire pressures in psi: 36 FL, 33 FR, 35 RL, 34 RR)\
`0x 00 00 24 4E 50 39 4E FE` (tire pressures in psi: 39 FL, 40 FR, 28 RL, 39 RR; RL highlighted yellow, TPMS light on)\
`0x 00 00 24 37 35 48 46 FE` (tire pressures in psi: 27 FL, 26 FR, 36 RL, 35 RR; FL and FR highlighted yellow, TPMS light on)

Channel name | Equation | Notes
------------ | -------- | -----
Tire pressure FL | `lowPass(D >> 1, 126) * 6.8948` | Result is in kPa (as RaceChrono expects)
Tire pressure FR | `lowPass(E >> 1, 126) * 6.8948` | Ditto
Tire pressure RL | `lowPass(F >> 1, 126) * 6.8948` | Ditto
Tire pressure RR | `lowPass(G >> 1, 126) * 6.8948` | Ditto
TPMS light on | `(C >> 5) & 1` |
Low pressure FL | `D & 1` | The FL tire pressure is shown in yellow when this bit is set
Low pressure FR | `E & 1` | Ditto
Low pressure RL | `F & 1` | Ditto
Low pressure RR | `G & 1` | Ditto

Based on my limited testing, the order of tires matches how the pressures are displayed
in the gauge cluster, i.e. correctly account for tire rotation, etc.

These values were read from a US market car where pressures are displayed in psi.
I suspect that cars on other markets (using bar or kPa) will use a different scale
in the data encoding. Please let me know if you find any data examples from non-US
cars and I'll add them here!
